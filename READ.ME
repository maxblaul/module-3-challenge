For this homework I had to make a random password generator using JS. 
I understood what was going on and what pseudo-code and steps i needed to include. However i struggled a lot with the order
of things and the syntax of Javascript functions. I worked with both a tutor and Sam the teacher assistant. I was able to get
the results I needed after Sam helped me. Most of the ideas behind the code are present. I just need more practice with the overall
flow, arrangement and rules to JS.
